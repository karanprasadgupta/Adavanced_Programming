## Description
The Advanced Programming course was designed to provide practical examples and exercises to deepen our understanding of advanced programming concepts. It covered a wide range of topics, including data structures, Interface & Polymorphism, design patterns, OOPS, Generic Programming, and more.

## Advanced Programming- Assignments
The repository contains the following projects:

1. #### [Assignment-1](Assignment-1/src)
   ##### **Topic:** `Classes, Objects & Class Relationships`
   To efficiently manage citizens and hospitals in a city, designing a software application called COVIN that allows for a streamlined       procedure to citizens, hospitals and officials to manage this difficult task.
2. #### [Assignment-2](Assignment-2/src)
    ##### **Topic:** `Interface & Polymorphism`
    Ever since the arrival of Google Classroom (GC), it has been the go-to Learning Management
    System (LMS) for IIITD. LMS is the backbone of how teaching is delivered at IIITD. For quite
    some time now, it has been observed that IIITD should have its very own LMS, and the institute
    administration has named the project, "BACKPACK". You have been contacted by BYLD, the
    developer group at IIITD to give your inputs on this project. They want you to use the
    knowledge of OOP that you have gathered from Assignment-1 along with interfaces, and
    polymorphism to design a robust system that can support multiple roles. The system will be
    used by Instructors (a single course can have multiple instructors like GC) and Students.
    For now, you are supposed to design a single course page that has users for the roles
    mentioned above and show BYLD a working command line simulation.

3.  #### [Assignment-3](Assignment-4/src)
    ##### **Topic:** `Classes and Objects, Class Relationships, Exception Handling, Object Cloning and Generic Programming.`
    A single-player game with a really simple objective: the player gets 5 chances to hop and
    land on the carpet of tiles. Every time the player lands on a random tile, s/he may win a soft toy.
    The player stores all the soft toys he has won in a bucket. Once the player has hopped five
    times, the game ends after listing out the details of the soft toys won by the player.

Each project directory includes the necessary code and any additional resources required to complete the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/karanprasadgupta/Adavanced_Programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd Adavanced_Programming
   ```
3. Explore the projects and their respective directories. Each project may have its own set of programs and dependencies, so to run a specific project switch to the project directory and execute the `Main.java` file.
