To efficiently manage citizens and hospitals in a city, designing a software application called COVIN that allows for a streamlined procedure to citizens, hospitals and officials to manage this difficult task.
#### [Assignment-2](Assignment-2/src)
##### **Topic:** `Interface & Polymorphism`

Ever since the arrival of Google Classroom (GC), it has been the go-to Learning Management
System (LMS) for IIITD. LMS is the backbone of how teaching is delivered at IIITD. For quite
some time now, it has been observed that IIITD should have its very own LMS, and the institute
administration has named the project, "BACKPACK". You have been contacted by BYLD, the
developer group at IIITD to give your inputs on this project. They want you to use the
knowledge of OOP that you have gathered from Assignment-1 along with interfaces, and
polymorphism to design a robust system that can support multiple roles. The system will be
used by Instructors (a single course can have multiple instructors like GC) and Students.
For now, you are supposed to design a single course page that has users for the roles
mentioned above and show BYLD a working command line simulation.

#### [Assignment-3](Assignment-4/src)
##### **Topic:** `Classes and Objects, Class Relationships, Exception Handling, Object Cloning and Generic Programming.`

A single-player game with a really simple objective: the player gets 5 chances to hop and
land on the carpet of tiles. Every time the player lands on a random tile, s/he may win a soft toy.
The player stores all the soft toys he has won in a bucket. Once the player has hopped five
times, the game ends after listing out the details of the soft toys won by the player.
