# IIITD CSE201-Adavanced Programming

### Advanced Programming- Assignments
#### [Assignment-1](Assignment-1/src)
##### **Topic:** `Classes, Objects & Class Relationships`

To efficiently manage citizens and hospitals in a city, designing a software application called COVIN that allows for a streamlined procedure to citizens, hospitals and officials to manage this difficult task.
#### [Assignment-2](Assignment-2/src)
##### **Topic:** `Interface & Polymorphism`

Ever since the arrival of Google Classroom (GC), it has been the go-to Learning Management
System (LMS) for IIITD. LMS is the backbone of how teaching is delivered at IIITD. For quite
some time now, it has been observed that IIITD should have its very own LMS, and the institute
administration has named the project, "BACKPACK". You have been contacted by BYLD, the
developer group at IIITD to give your inputs on this project. They want you to use the
knowledge of OOP that you have gathered from Assignment-1 along with interfaces, and
polymorphism to design a robust system that can support multiple roles. The system will be
used by Instructors (a single course can have multiple instructors like GC) and Students.
For now, you are supposed to design a single course page that has users for the roles
mentioned above and show BYLD a working command line simulation.
